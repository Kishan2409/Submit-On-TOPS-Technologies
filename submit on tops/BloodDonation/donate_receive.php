                                Blood donation is safe for healthy adults. Thereâ€™s no risk of
                                contracting
                                disease.
                                New,sterile equipment is used for each donor.

                            <p>
                                Some people may feel nauseous, lightheaded, or dizzy after donating
                                blood. If
                                this
                                happens, it should only last a few minutes. You can lie down with your
                                feet up
                                at
                                the until you feel better.

                                You may also experience some bleeding at the site of the needle.
                                Applying
                                pressure
                                and
                                raising your arm for a couple of minutes will usually stop this. You may
                                develop
                                a
                                bruise at the site.
